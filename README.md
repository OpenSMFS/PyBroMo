# PyBroMo Overview

**[PyBroMo](http://tritemio.github.io/PyBroMo/)** is an open-source simulator
for Brownian-motion diffusion and photon emission of fluorescent particles
excited by a diffraction limited laser spot.
PyBroMo allows to simulate timestamps of photons emitted during
[smFRET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-molecule_FRET) experiments,
including sample background and detectors dark counts and to save the results in
in [Photon-HDF5](htpps://photon-hdf5.org) format.

> For a smFRET burst analysis software see [FRETBursts](https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts).

PyBromo simulates 3-D Brownian motion trajectories and emission of an
arbitrary number of particles freely diffusing in a simulation volume (a box).
Inside the simulation box a laser excitation volume (the
[PSF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_spread_function) of the objective lens)
is defined numerically or analytically (Gaussian shape). Particles diffusing
through the excitation volume emit photons at a rate proportional to the
local excitation intensity.

A precomputed numerical [PSF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_spread_function)
is included and used by default.
The included numerical PSF is computed through
[rigorous vectorial electromagnetic computations]
(http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/JOSAA.27.000295) using the
[PSFLab](http://onemolecule.chem.uwm.edu/software) software.
The user can provide a different numerical PSF or,
alternatively, use an analytical Gaussian-shaped PSF.

An overview of the architecture of the simulator can be found
[below](#architecture).

The user documentation is provided in a series of [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebooks
(see **[Usage examples](#usage-examples)**).

# Environment

PyBroMo is written in the [python programming language](http://www.python.org/)
using the standard scientific stack of libraries (numpy, scipy, pytables,
matplotlib).

Usage examples are given as
Jupyter/IPython notebooks.
[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) is an interactive web-based environment that allows to mix rich text, math and graphics with (live) code.
You can find a static HTML version of the notebooks below in section **[Usage examples](#usage-examples)**.

Moreover the [IPython environment](http://ipython.org/) allows to easily setup a cluster for parallel computing. Therefore simulation time can be
greatly reduced using a single multi-core PC, multiple PC or a cloud-computing service.

If you are new to Jupyter Notebook, refer to this guide for installation and first steps:

# Architecture

The simulation domain is defined as 3-D box, centered around the origin. The dimension on each direction (x, y, z) can be different. Periodic boundary conditions are applied.

A particle is described by its initial position. A list of particles with random initial position is generated by an utility function before running the simulation.

The excitation PSF is a function of the position and is centered with maximum on the origin. A realistic PSF obtained by vectorial electromagnetic simulation is precomputed using [PSFLab](http://onemolecule.chem.uwm.edu/software). The PSF is computed for a single wavelength and includes effects such as refractive index mismatch and mismatch between the objective lens correction and the cover-glass thickness. The user can  generate a different PSF using [PSFLab](http://onemolecule.chem.uwm.edu/software). The PSF is generated using circular polarized light so it has cylindrical symmetry and can precomputed only on the x-z plane.
Alternatively, a simple Gaussian PSF can also be used.

The Brownian motion parameters are: the diffusion coefficient, the simulation box, the list of particles, the simulation time step and the simulation final time.

The Brownian  motion simulation uses constant time-steps (typically 0.5 Î¼s).
This allows a straightforward and efficient implementation.
In fact, the trajectory is computed
in a single operation, integrating the (random) array of displacements with the
[`cumsum`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.cumsum.html) command. The drawback of this approach is the high RAM usage, although the
problem can be mitigated (see below).

The instantaneous emission rate of the particle is computed during the Brownian motion simulation, evaluating the PSF intensity at each position. Once the emission rate is computed at all the time-steps, photons are generated stochastically from a [Poisson process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_process). The rate of the Poisson process is the sum of the instantaneous emission rate and the background rate. The time bin in which a photon is extracted
is used as the photon (or dark count) timestamp.
Photo-physics effects, such as blinking and bleaching, are not currently
modeled.
However these effect can be easily included simply "modulating" the emission
rates before generating the photons.

To overcome the problem of high RAM usage of long simulations, the user can choose to delete the particle trajectory after the emission trace has been computed. Moreover, is possible to save a single cumulative array of emissions (for all the particles) instead of having a separate emission trace for each particle. Finally, the computation can be distributed on the nodes of a cluster (IPython cluster). Several batches of simulation can be executed on each node, making possible to simulate an arbitrary long experiment on limited hardware. Thanks to the IPython infrastructure the simulation can be seamless run on a single machine, on a cluster of machines or on a cloud computing server.
