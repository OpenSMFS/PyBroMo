Particles diffusing\r\nthrough the excitation volume emit photons at a rate proportional to the\r\nlocal excitation intensity.\r\n\r\nA precomputed numerical [PSF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_spread_function)\r\nis included and used by default.\r\nThe included numerical PSF is computed through\r\n[rigorous vectorial electromagnetic computations]\r\n(http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/JOSAA.27.000295) using the\r\n[PSFLab](http://onemolecule.chem.uwm.edu/software) software.\r\nThe user can provide a different numerical PSF or,\r\nalternatively, use an analytical Gaussian-shaped PSF.\r\n\r\nAn overview of the architecture of the simulator can be found\r\n[below](#architecture).\r\n\r\nThe user documentation is provided in a series of [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebooks\r\n(see **[Usage examples](#usage-examples)**).\r\n\r\n# Feedback\r\n\r\nIf you have a question or find a bug in PyBroMo please open a GitHub Issue.\r\nBug fixes and/or enhancements are welcome, just send a [pull request (PR)](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).\r\n\r\nFor more info contact me at tritemio@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n# Environment\r\n\r\nPyBroMo is written in the [python programming language](http://www.python.org/)\r\nusing the standard scientific stack of libraries (numpy, scipy, pytables,\r\nmatplotlib).\r\n\r\nUsage examples are given as\r\nJupyter/IPython notebooks.\r\n[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) is an interactive web-based environment that allows to mix rich text, math and graphics with (live) code.\r\nYou can find a static HTML version of the notebooks below in section **[Usage examples](#usage-examples)**.\r\n\r\nMoreover the [IPython environment](http://ipython.org/) allows to easily setup a cluster for parallel computing. Therefore simulation time can be\r\ngreatly reduced using a single multi-core PC, multiple PC or a cloud-computing service.\r\n\r\nIf you are new to Jupyter Notebook, refer to this guide for installation and first steps:\r\n\r\n- [Jupyter/IPython Notebook Quick Start Guide](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.org)\r\n\r\n# Architecture\r\n\r\nThe simulation domain is defined as 3-D box, centered around the origin. The dimension on each direction (x, y, z) can be different. Periodic boundary conditions are applied.\r\n\r\nA particle is described by its initial position. A list of particles with random initial position is generated by an utility function before running the simulation.\r\n\r\nThe excitation PSF is a function of the position and is centered with maximum on the origin. A realistic PSF obtained by vectorial electromagnetic simulation is precomputed using [PSFLab](http://onemolecule.chem.uwm.edu/software). The PSF is computed for a single wavelength and includes effects such as refractive index mismatch and mismatch between the objective lens correction and the cover-glass thickness. The user can  generate a different PSF using [PSFLab](http://onemolecule.chem.uwm.edu/software). The PSF is generated using circular polarized light so it has cylindrical symmetry and can precomputed only on the x-z plane.\r\nAlternatively, a simple Gaussian PSF can also be used.\r\n\r\nThe Brownian motion parameters are: the diffusion coefficient, the simulation box, the list of particles, the simulation time step and the simulation final time.\r\n\r\nThe Brownian  motion simulation uses constant time-steps (typically 0.5 Î¼s).\r\nThis allows a straightforward and efficient implementation.\r\nIn fact, the trajectory is computed\r\nin a single operation, integrating the (random) array of displacements with the\r\n[`cumsum`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.cumsum.html) command. The drawback of this approach is the high RAM usage, although the\r\nproblem can be mitigated (see below).\r\n\r\nThe instantaneous emission rate of the particle is computed during the Brownian motion simulation, evaluating the PSF intensity at each position. Once the emission rate is computed at all the time-steps, photons are generated stochastically from a [Poisson process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_process). The rate of the Poisson process is the sum of the instantaneous emission rate and the background rate. The time bin in which a photon is extracted\r\nis used as the photon (or dark count) timestamp.\r\nPhoto-physics effects, such as blinking and bleaching, are not currently\r\nmodeled.\r\nHowever these effect can be easily included simply \"modulating\" the emission\r\nrates before generating the photons.\r\n\r\nTo overcome the problem of high RAM usage of long simulations, the user can choose to delete the particle trajectory after the emission trace has been computed. Moreover, is possible to save a single cumulative array of emissions (for all the particles) instead of having a separate emission trace for each particle. Finally, the computation can be distributed on the nodes of a cluster (IPython cluster). Several batches of simulation can be executed on each node, making possible to simulate an arbitrary long experiment on limited hardware. Thanks to the IPython infrastructure the simulation can be seamless run on a single machine, on a cluster of machines or on a cloud computing server.\r\n\r\n# Usage examples\r\n\r\nPyBroMo includes a collection of notebooks which serves both as usage examples\r\nand user guide.
